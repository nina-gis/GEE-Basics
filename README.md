# NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)
Tropospheric vertical column density of NO₂.  
**Units:** mol/m²  
**Description:** The number of moles of NO₂ molecules in a vertical column of air from the surface to the top of the troposphere, per square metre. Derived from TROPOMI slant column measurements and converted to vertical columns using air mass factors.

# CO (Carbon Monoxide)
Total vertical column density of CO.  
**Units:** mol/m²  
**Description:** The number of moles of CO molecules in the entire atmospheric column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, per square metre. Sensitive mainly to the troposphere and retrieved from shortwave infrared (~2.3 µm) spectral measurements.

# O₃ (Ozone)
Total column ozone from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.  
**Units:** mol/m²  
**Description:** The number of moles of O₃ molecules in the entire atmospheric column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, per square metre. Represents both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, retrieved using the GODFIT algorithm applied to ultraviolet spectral measurements.

# HCHO (Formaldehyde)
Tropospheric vertical column of formaldehyde.  
**Units:** mol/m²  
**Description:** The number of moles of HCHO molecules in a vertical column of air from the surface to the top of the troposphere, per square metre. Formaldehyde is a short-lived oxidation product of volatile organic compounds and serves as an indicator of biogenic emissions and biomass burning activity.

# CH₄ (Methane)
Column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of methane (XCH₄).  
**Units:** parts per billion (ppb)  
**Description:** The ratio of CH₄ to dry air, averaged over the entire atmospheric column. This quantity represents the mean methane concentration per unit of dry air and is derived from the integration of the vertical methane profile normalized by the total dry-air column. It reflects the total methane burden in the atmosphere.
